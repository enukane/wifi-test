**	  Testing environment	       ** 
*****************************************

The minimum testing system requirements are listed below.
a) Two test machines
   One as test machine, the other as peer machine in IBSS network testing. 
   If only BSS is tested, one test machine is enough.
b) One server machine
   The server machine needs two Ethernet cards, one connects to the 
   Test machine network and the other to the AP network.
c) One AP
   Both Cisco AP, Dlink and ASUS AP with CLI (Command Line Interface)
   are supported. For example, Dlink DWL-8200 AP and Cisco1200 series AP. 

Here is an example of our test environment:

  --------------
 | Test Machine |
  --------------\
                 \ ---------                    --------
                  | Test    |     -------      |  AP    |   ---
                  | machine |----| Server |----| network|--| AP |
                  | network |     -------      |        |   ---
                 / ---------                    --------

******************************************
**		Quick Start		**
******************************************
Precondition
1. This test script license is GPLv2. But this test script needs tet from
   http://tetworks.opengroup.org/tet/, tet license is Artistic.
2. perl-Net-Telnet packages should be installed in Server.
3. Currently, Quick Start only supports Cisco AP. 
   We have tested on Fedora System and Cisco1252 AP.
4. Suggest to Reset Cisco AP to Factory Defaults (Except IP Address).
   <SYSTEM SOFTWARE> -> <System Configuration> -> <Reset to Factory
   Defaults (Except IP Address)>
5. Have to run testing as root.

Part1: Setup Server & AP network
================================
a) Get the wireless test script. 
b) Copy the apset directory to <server machine>:/usr/local/bin/. 
   Configure the following environmental variables in 
   /usr/local/bin/apset/apset.cisco/config.pm 
     $ap: AP IP address in the AP network
     $ssid_2g: SSID of 802.11g band, it has to be xxx-2.4g, such as cisco-2.4g
     $ssid_5g: SSID of 802.11a band, it has to be xxx-5g, such as cisco-5g
     $EAP_Server: EAP Server IP
     $Shared_Secret: Sharedsecret used in WPA authentication
     $AP_Login: Login username
     $AP_Password: Login password
     $AP_Enable_Password: IOS enable password
c) Now, you are able to set AP automatically by running AP setting scripts. 
   For example, setting AP's mode and channel.  
     ./apset.cisco MODE A-ONLY CHANNEL 40.

Part2. Setup Test Machine & Peer Machine
========================================
a) Put the wireless test script in Test Machine
b) If test machine does not have Internet access, you have to download tet
   (see howto.txt Part2) and put it into the wireless test script directory.
   Note that tet license is Artistic.
c) Install and configure test environment
   ./config.sh -flrt
   (input accordingly)
d) Run sanity testing:
   . /etc/TVSEnvironment
   tvs run
e) If two cases passed, Congratulations, you make test script running!

Part3. Start Testing!
=====================
a) /usr/tet/TVS/tset/iwl/tet_scen defines many scenarios for different purpose.
   For example, p1_a is the p1 testing on 802.11a mode.
   You can define your own testing scenarios.
b) /usr/tet/TVS/etc/TVSListing defines which scenarios that will be run.
   For example, run ABAT testing on 802.11a mode using the following scenarios .
	iwl Start_A_Band
	iwl bat_a
   Notes: Start_A_Band, or bat_a etc, are test scenarios that defined in tet_scen
c) Run test script:
   . /etc/TVSEnvironment
   tvs run
d) Get the testing reports from /usr/tet/TVS/Reports/latest, 
   here are the testing reports for the latest testing.


******************************************
**	Manual configuration            **
******************************************

The above section gets you start testing as quickly as possible.
This section will explain how to configure the testing environment manually. 
You can skip this section, if the Quick Start works for you. 

Part1: Setup Server & AP network
================================

a) Repeat the step a) in Quick Start Part1.
b) If using Cisco AP, please repeat step b) in Quick Start Part1.
   If using Dlink AP,
   1. make sure that "expect" is installed on the server machine
   2. use "admin" as the User Name and "admin" as the Password in AP LOGIN page. 
      Or modify the APUSER and APPSWD in /usr/local/bin/apset/apset.dlink/pswd.exp
   3. Configure the following variables in /usr/local/bin/apset/apset.dlink/apset.dlink.
        APIP: AP IP address in the AP network
        SSID_G: SSID of 802.11g band, it has to be xxx-2.4g, such as otc-dlink-2.4g
        SSID_A: SSID of 802.11a band, it has to be xxx-5g, such as otc-dlink-5g
c) Use ssh-keygen to generate id_rsa.pub the public key of test machine. 
d) Copy the public key to server machine and cat it into \
   root@<Server>:/root/.ssh/authorized_keys,
   making the test machine a trusted station of server machine.

Part2. Setup Test Machine & Peer Machine
========================================
a) Install tet on test machine. It is by default installed at /usr/tet.
    download http://tetworks.opengroup.org/tet/tet3.7a-unsup.src.tar.gz
    tar zxf tet3.7a-unsup.src.tar.gz
    sh configure -t lite
    cd src; make; make install
    cd ..
    mkdir -p /usr/tet
    cp -r bin inc lib /usr/tet
b) Install the wireless test script on test machine.
    make
    make install
c) Copy id_rsa.pub of test machine to the peer machine and cat it into 
   root@<Peer>:/root/.ssh/authorized_keys,
   making the test machine a trusted station of the peer machine.
d) Edit /usr/tet/TVS/tsets/iwl/tvs_env
    iwl_ap        #which AP you want to use in testing. 
                   Note that the suffix -2.4g or -5g is not needed here. 
    iwl_wap       #AP IP address
    iwl_apset_cmd #Where you put the AP setting script
    iwl_esrv      #Server hostname
    iwl_wsrv      #Server IP address in wireless network
    iwl_whost     #Test machine IP address in wireless network
    iwl_epeer     #Peer machine hostname
    iwl_wpeer     #Peer machine IP address in wireless network
    iwl_load_module_vendor	#Wireless card vendor (see )

Part3. Start Testing!
=====================
This part is the same as Quick Start Part3. 


******************************************
**      Different card support          **
******************************************

This test script was written for Intel wireless cards, considering 
the compatibility with wireless cards from other vendors. The general
test cases are hardware independent except for driver loading. So the
test script make driver-loading as configurable function.

a) Define the global variable iwl_load_module_vendor in
   /usr/tet/TVS/tsets/iwl/tvs_env. By default, it is set to 
   iwl_load_iwlwifi, which supports iwl3945 and iwlagn.
b) Currently, two load modules are supported. 
   iwl_load_iwlwifi() for iwl3945 and iwlagn
   iwl_load_evp() for iwmc3200wifi
   Details can be found in /usr/tet/TVS/tsets/iwl/ts/iwl_common.sh


******************************************
** Different wireless utility support   **
******************************************

Up to now most test cases use wireless extension. But in the future, we will
use iw/nl80211. To use iw/nl80211, we can add a line:
. iwl_iw.sh
between two sequent lines at the bottom of each test suites (like wep.sh)
. iwl_common.sh
. $TVS_ROOT/lib/TVSFunctions.sh

Please refer to abat_iw.sh


******************************************
**    Contribute to the test suites     **
******************************************

If you want to contribute to the test suites, please go to /usr/tet/TVS/tsets/iwl/ts. 
The scripts named as iwl_xxx.sh are common function scripts, others are test case scripts. 
Those iwl_xxx.sh scripts are worth reading to understand how the automation testing works.
