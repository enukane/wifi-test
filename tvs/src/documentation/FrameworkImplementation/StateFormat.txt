At any given time in the lifecycle of a TVS run, $TVS_ROOT/var/state 
contains the current state of TVS.  This state is used by outside
applications/scripts in determining the progress of TVS, and is also
used internal to TVS for determining where to pickup from when TVS
has been restarted.

NOTE: If $TVS_ROOT/var/state does not exist then TVS has completed

The format of the state file is:
RUNNING|RESTART|ABORT|COMPLETE SESSION_ID CURRENT_SUITE_NAME SCENERIO 

RUNNING            - Indicates that TVS is currently running
RESTART            - Indicates that TVS has requested a reboot
                     and should be restarted using the same suite/scenerio
                     when the system is back up.
ABORT              - Indicates that TVS aborted its last run and
                     is no longer running.
COMPLETE           - Indicates that TVS completed its last run.
SESSION_ID         - Unique ID associated with a given run of TVS.
                     Restarts will pickup on the same session ID.
CURRENT_SUITE_NAME - Name of validation suite being executed
SCENERIO           - Name of scenerio the current suite is using
