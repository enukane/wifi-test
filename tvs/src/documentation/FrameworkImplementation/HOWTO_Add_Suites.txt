To have a validation suite added to the official list TVS validation suites, built 
automatically by the build system and distributed as an integral part of TVS, follow 
the steps here:
1.	Add your suite directory into "tvs/src/TestSuites/" in cvs. 
2.	Add a line in tvs/etc/TVSListing. TVSListing contains a record per line, where 
each validation suite gets a single record.  The record is then split into fields 
delimited by white space.  The first entry is the name of the validation suite 
where the name of the validation suite is the name of the root directory for the 
validation suite.  Each additional field contains the scenario names for TVS to 
execute on the validation suite in order from left to right.
For example, given the following record:
"Feature_X_Suite PRD2.3 PRD2.4 PRD2.5"
3.	Append your suite directory name to "TESTSUITES" in 
tvs/src/TestSuites/Makefile. There is line in this makefile that defines all the 
suites that need to be built. That is:
TESTSUITES =  suite1 suite2 suite3 Feature_X_Suite
Just append your suite directory name at the end of this line. 
4.	Write a makefile in each of your test case's directory. In this makefile, build 
your test case to binary format and copy them to the installed directory. See 
the example below and template in tvs/src/TestSuites/
5.	In your test suite's tet_scen file, write a scenario named "build" and list the 
test case here. When building your test case,  TVS will invoke "tcc" to build 
according your test suite's tet_scen file and its scenario "build". For each line 
in this scenario, tcc will try to call "make" at the test case's directory, so each 
of you test case directory needs a makefile and you needs to put line at 
scenario "build" in the tet_scen file.
The following is an example:
If your test suite named SuiteOne and have one test case named testcase1, the 
directory structure may look like this:                                      
tvs/
 |-- Makefile
 |-- tvs.spec
 | 
 |__src/
     |-- tsets/
     |     |-- SuiteOne/
     |             |-- tet_scen/
     |             | -- test1/
     |                   | -- testcase1                                                |
     |
     |-- src/
     |    |-- TestSuites
                  |-- SuiteOne/
                         |-- tet_scen/
                         |-- tset/
                              | -- test1/
                                      | -- Makefile
                                      | -- testcase1.c     
| -- testcase1                                           
Here tvs/src/src is the source file directory and you need to add the suite here. The 
tvs/src/tsets directory is the installed directory and you should install your suite here 
in your test case's makefile.
So the makefile may like this:
DEPTH = ../../../../..
LIBDIR	= $(TET_ROOT)/lib/tet3
TVSLIBDIR = $(DEPTH)/lib/
TVSINCDIR = $(DEPTH)/inc
INCDIR	= $(TET_ROOT)/inc/tet3
CFLAGS	= -I$(INCDIR) -I$(TVSINCDIR)
all	install :build
	mkdir -p  ${DEPTH}/tsets/SuiteOne/test1
	cp tc1 ${DEPTH}/tsets/SuiteOne/test1
build: tc1.c $(INCDIR)/tet_api.h $(TVSINCDIR)/TVSFunctions.h 
$(TVSLIBDIR)/TVSFunctions.o
	gcc $(CFLAGS) -o testcase1 testcase1.c $(TVSLIBDIR)/TVSFunctions.o 
$(LIBDIR)/tcm.o $(LIBDIR)/libapi.a $(SYSLIBS)
clean:
	rm -f *.o testcase1
And the tet_scen file may look like this:
build
	/tset/testcase1/testcase1
all
	"starting scenario"
	/testcase1/testcase1
	"done"
