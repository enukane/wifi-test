TVS contains a text file, $TVS_ROOT/etc/TVSListing, which list all 
information about which validation suites using which scenerios need to be 
run, and in what order.

TVSLising uses the following format:
SUITENAME SCENERIO1 SCENERIO2 ...

Where each line is a record, and the validation suites are executed from top 
to bottom using the scenerios listed from left to right.
