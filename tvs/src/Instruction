================================================================
  This file contain the brief instruction for running test suite
 of each components, such as special configration, how to modify
 "TVSListing" file,etc.
  Each component will have a section.
================================================================
[SNMPAgent]
  Just run tvs, the 7 scenarios can be run automatically
[ngpt]
-- make sure ngpt and ngpt-devel rpm are installed
$ vi /usr/tet/TVS/etc/TVSListing
   --- For TLT, add "ngpt standard bincomp"
   --- For MVL, add "ngpt mvl_standard mvl_bincomp"
$ tvs run

[dprobes]
-- make sure dprobes and kernel-source rpm are installed
1. check if dprobes is built into kernel by default 
$ dprobes -r -a	  -- Expected to print: "Remove dprobes on all modules"

2. When dprobes is built-in by default or manually rebuilt,
$ vi /usr/tet/TVS/etc/TVSListing
   --- For TLT  add "dprobes tlt"
   --- For MVL	add "dprobes mvl"

3. If needed to recompile kernel,
--- configuration
$ vi /usr/tet/TVS/tsets/dprobes/bin/Config.py
   --- set the expected 'BUILD_LABEL'
   --- set the correct 'KERNEL_CONFIG'
   --- set the correct 'KERNEL_VERSION'
   --- set the correct 'RPM_KERNEL_SRC_DIR'
   --- set the correct 'KERNEL_SRC'
	--- For TLT	build, it's the resolute path of kernel-source rpm
	--- For MVL	build, it's the location of kernel source directory
$ vi /usr/tet/TVS/tsets/dprobes/bin/makebin.sh
   --- set the correct 'KERNEL_SRC_PATH'
	--- For TLT	build, it's the newly installed kernel source tree
	--- For MVL	build, it's the location of kernel source tree
--- run test cases
$ vi /etc/TVSEnvironment
   --- set TVS_REBOOT_ON_RESTART = 1
$ vi /usr/tet/TVS/etc/TVSListing
   --- add "dprobes prep probes post"
$ tvs run

    In TVSListing file, the scenario "noaction" doesn't need to 
reboot.

[MCA]
Before running the test suite, two files need to be edited:

1. Edit ${TVSROOT}/tsets/MCA/pylib/Config.py
   - KERNEL_SOURCE can be set to a kernel source rpm file name
     or the path of the kernel source path.
   - KERNEL_VERSION is necessary only if you need to make a ram
     disk.
   - set KERNEL_CONFIG to the kernel config file appears in the
     "configs" directory of kernel source. If you want to use
     the default ".config", set it to ""

2. Edit ${TVSROOT}/tsets/MCA/pylib/Control.py
   - set USE_INITRD to 1 if you want to make a ram disk.
   - set PENTIUM4 to 1 if you are using a pentium 4 platform.
   - set BOOT_LOADER to Grub or Lilo according to what you are
     using now.
   - MCATS_DEBUG should be set to 0 to test the MCA component
     instead of the MCA test suite itself.
