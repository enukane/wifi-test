APSET RSH HOWTO

This document will give a step by step instructions to introduce how to use
apset tool to enable testcases run automaticly.

[NOTE]	1. This tools currently support ASUS WL500g and Linksys WRT54G Access 
	   point with according firmware.
	2. Before this you must be sure you know how to configure your AP 
	   back your original setting, because our tests will change ap 
	   setting frequencily, that's why we write this tool.

Steps:
	1. If you are using ASUS-WL500g, please go to
	   http://wl500g.info/
	   download suitable firmware, which authored by Oleg, not official.
	   If you are using WRT54G, please go to
	   http://www.linksysinfo.org/
	   to download ewrt-0.3-beta to update your firmware.
	2. Update firmware through web interface original firmware offered.
	   For asus: 	System SETUP -> Firmware Upgrade.
	   For Linksys: Administration -> Firmware Upgrade.
	   Please keep power non-stopped!!!
	3. ewrt has offered ssh service automaticly.
	   To WL500-g, you need telnet to it first; then 
	   	create a file named "post-boot" under /tmp/local/sbin
		and 
		  # echo '#!/bin/sh' >> /tmp/local/sbin/post-boot
		  # echo "dropbear"  >> /tmp/local/sbin/post-boot
		and then
		  # mkdir -p /usr/local/etc/dropbear
		  # dropbearkey -t dss -f \
		  	/usr/local/etc/dropbear/dropbear_dss_host_key
		  # dropbearkey -t rsa -f \
		  	/usr/local/etc/dropbear/dropbear_rsa_host_key
	    The following steps will enable your AP system can be reached from
	    WAN port. If your AP is used as a node to outside network, you'd 
	    better not follow these instructsions. Anyway, you can connect to
	    AP by Lan ports and wireless connection by default.
	    	  # touch /usr/local/sbin/post-firewall
		  # echo "#!/bin/sh" >> /usr/local/sbin/post-firewall
		  # echo "iptables -D INPUT -j DROP" \
		  	>> /usr/local/sbin/post-firewall
		  # echo "iptables -A INPUT -p tcp \
		  	--dport 22 -j ACCEPT" >> /usr/local/sbin/post-firewall
		  # echo "iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING \
		  	-i $1 -p tcp --dport 22 -j DNAT \
			--to-destination $4:22" \
			>> /usr/local/sbin/post-firewall
		  # echo "iptables -A INPUT -j DROP" \
		  	>> /usr/local/sbin/post-firewall
	    The following steps MUST be excuted, or your effort on configuration
	    will be lost.
	    	  # flashfs save
		  # flashfs commit
		  # flashfs enable
		  # reboot
	    You can also refer to http://www.macsat.com/JustSSHGuide.php for 
	    more detail steps to config ssh service.
	4. After Big Step 3, we can ssh to 192.168.1.1, default user & pswd are 
	   both "admin". You can modify password by 'passwd' command, Do 
	   remember flashfs save, commit, and enable must be execute, because of	   the file  system.
	   Then you can install the auto-config tool for AP, 
	   	  # cp -r apset.sh/ /usr/bin
	   	  # ln -s /usr/bin/apset.rsh/apset.new /usr/bin/apset
	   and you need to edit some options in this directory,
	   	  # vi /usr/bin/apset.rsh/pswd.exp
	   check if variable APUSER and APPSWD is right for you.
	5. And make sure your Laptop are correctly connect to AP by Lan at 
	   least, then run the following command: 
	          # apset --reset
	   If you see some command(nvram ... exit) are auto executed and AP 
	   power light blink to reboot, Congratulations, you can do automatic 
	   tests.
