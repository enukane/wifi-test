NEW ipw-auto tool:apset.rsh/
1.Why new?
2.How new?
3.How to know if this tool can be used on my AP?
4.How to setup?

1.Why new?
	We have a ipw-auto tool before to change ap setting(apset.web/),
	which simulate a http client to make AP configuration change.
	But this is hard to control when ap change 
	even firmware update(server page change).
	Some day I found firmware run on AP is embed linux, which is 
	opensource, and some group are modifying it for advance configuraion
	or function purpose. Key point is most of them setup ssh server on
	AP. So we can telnet/ssh to the embed linux, and change AP setting,
	such as ssid, channel etc. by command.

2.How new?
	Finally I found it's convenient change AP setting by "nvram", 
	which is the general tool on flash mem based system.So I build
	a new file apset.new to change ap setting, nvram is easy to use:
	nvram [show|get|set] [name=value] [commit]
	For example: we need to change the ssid of AP:
		nvram set wl_ssid=abcde
		nvram commit
		reboot	
	then it will works fine with new ssid abcde.
	
	The problem to us is to find out what "name" is related to our setting,
	which always be boring, and a more boring thing is there are trivial
	different between different firmware, in fact 80% of "name" between
	differnet firmware, and there is no firwware can be used on both ASUS
	and LINKSYS ap.
	
3.How to know if this tool can be used on my AP?
	I have test it on ASUS WL-500g with 1.9.2.7-5a (which can be download
	at http://www.chupa.nl/beta/wizard.php?brand=1&mode=1&cat=firmware).
	I think WL-500g with firmware by Oleg can use this tool.
	And WRT54G with openwrt firmware can also use it.	

4.How to setup?
	cp apset.new pswd.exp /usr/bin/ipw-auto
	ln -s /usr/bin/ipw-auto/apset.new /usr/bin/apset
